I'm a passionate open source developer from New York. _(he/him)_

By day, I'm a staff frontend developer on the Web Platform team at at [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com), where I focus on our shared static analysis, testing, and accessibility tooling.

In my spare time, I contribute to assorted open source projects in the TypeScript ecosystem, and am writing a [_Learning TypeScript_ book for O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-typescript/9781098110321/).
I'm passionate about bringing accessible education to the masses in a sustainable way.

## Areas of Focus

* ü¶æ **Accessibility**: I started the accessibility initiative at Codecademy and ran the internal working group from 2019-2021. We took the site from poor accessibility to leading the industry.
* üó£Ô∏è **Conferences**: I've been doing the circuit of speaking engagements to share knowledge. You can see my talks [listed on my personal site](https://joshuakgoldberg.com/#talks).
* ‚ö° **Performance**: I was a member of the small performance team on [Sway](https://sway.office.com) and co-architected the wonderfully fast client frontend for its Word Transform to Webpage integration.
* ‚öõÔ∏è **React**: I've been using React professionally and on personal projects since 2015, and led Codecademy's internal switch from preferring class components to function components and hooks. Don't even get me started on MobX. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
* <img alt="TypeScript logo" style="height:1.2em;width:1em;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Typescript_logo_2020.svg" /> **TypeScript**: Gosh do I love TypeScript. I file issues on and submit PRs to the TypeScript language. You might enjoy my [TSConf](https://tsconf.io) talks on building [binary arithmetic](https://blog.joshuakgoldberg.com/binary-arithmetic) or a [board game engine](https://blog.joshuakgoldberg.com/type-system-game-engines) in the type system. 
* ü§ù **Volunteering**: I regularly take on mentees and work with organizations such as [Pursuit](https://www.pursuit.org), or back when I lived in Seattle, [Unloop](https://www.un-loop.org).
